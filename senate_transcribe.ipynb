the clerk and we will work resolve the issue if you experience other technical challenges please contact the ISD service desk with the technical assistance number provided in the meeting confirmation document before we begin our discussions in order to safeguard the confidentiality of conversations i remind centers their staff and committee support staff participating in this meeting that it is their responsibility to ensure that the environment in which they find themselves is private and that conversations held in the context of this committee meeting cannot be overheard by third parties participants should know to do so in a private area and to be mindful of their surroundings my name is dan christmas i'm a senator from novuskochia and i am the chair uh privileged to be the chair of this committee i would like to introduce the members of the committee who are participating in this meeting senator margaret dawn anderson the northwest territories senator mary coil from novuskochia senator jose for a thing from ontario that should be joined us a little later senator brian francis from prince Edward island senator marty deacon from ontario senator patty labocaine benson from Alberta senator Michael L McDonald from novuskochia senator Kim pate from Ontario Senator Dennis Glenn Patterson from Nunavut Senator Carol Carolyn Stewart Olson from New Brunswick Senator Scott Tanis from Alberta and other senators are also attending with us this afternoon uh Senator Mary Jane McCollum from Manitoba and Senator Mark Cole from Quebec we are meeting to consider bill c15 during our pre-study we heard from many witnesses and we are now at the stage where we'll begin going through the bill clause by clause before we do this i would like to remind senators of a few points if at any point a senator is not clear where we are in the process please ask for clarification we must do our utmost to ensure that we have the same understanding of where we are in the process i wish to advise senators that we do have officials from both crown indigenous relations and northern affairs canada and the department of justice can't on hand to answer any technical questions that may arise during this meeting in terms of the mechanics of the process i wish to remind senators that when more than one amendment is going to be moved in a clause the amendment should be proposed in the order of the lines of a clause therefore before we take up an amendment in a clause i will verify i will be verifying whether any senators had intended to move an amendment earlier in that clause if senators do intend to move an earlier amendment they will be given the chance to do so one small point if a senator is opposed to an entire clause i would remind that in committee the proper process is not to move a motion to delete the entire clause but rather to vote against the clause standing as part of the bill i would remind senators that some amendments that are moved may have consequential effects on other parts of the bill it is very important that the committee remain consistent in its decisions and that they be consistently applied throughout the bill it would be very useful for this process if a senator moving an amendment identified to the committee other clauses in this bill where this amendment could have an effect otherwise it would be very difficult for members of the committee to remain consistent in their decision making staff will endeavor to keep track of these places where subsequent amendments need to be moved and will draw our attention to them because no notice is required to move amendments there can of course have there can of course have been no preliminary analysis of amendments to establish which ones may be consequent to others and which may be contradictory if members ever have questions about process or a variety of anything going on they can raise a point of order the chair will listen to the argument decide when there has been sufficient discussion on a matter of order and make a ruling the committee is of course the ultimate master of its business within the bounds set on it by the senate and a ruling can be appealed to the full committee by asking whether the ruling shall be sustained as chair i will do my utmost to ensure that the senators wishing to speak can do so for this however i will depend upon your cooperation now ask all of you to think of other senators and to keep remarks to the point and as brief as possible finally i wish to remind senators that if there is ever any uncertainty as the results of a voice vote or shore of heads the cleanest route is to request request a recorded vote which provides clear results senators are aware that any tide boat that indicates the motion in question gotta take a breath are there any questions on what i've just read above okay i see some nods and some yes sandor for anything thank you chair i just wanted to apologize for my mishap earlier i was with you and i had a little mishap with the off button on my computer so i am back with you and i i was able to join from the beginning thank you very much thank you senator i appreciate uh let me know that um so i think we're good to go um i believe we can now proceed so i have a series of questions for you is it agreed that the committee proceed to clause by clause consideration of bill c15 an act respecting the united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous people agreed agreed agreed agreed thank you agreed agreed thank you agreed the next question shall the title stand postponed agreed agreed thank you agreed shall the preamble stand postponed agreed agreed agreed shall clause one which contains the short title stand postponed three agreed great great clause two shall clause two carry carry it mr chair thank you mr paterson senator paterson yes thank you mr chair i'd like to propose an amendment to clause two on page four which has been circulated in advance to the to the clerk may i go ahead yes i have it in front of me now senator paterson yes you can go ahead okay so i move that bill c15 be amended in clause two on page four by adding the following after line 23 2.1 for greater certainty nothing in this act affects the validity of judicial decisions rendered prior to its coming into force that's the amendment mr chair thank you senator paterson you wish to comment further on the amendment yes thank you mr chair this is a clarifying amendment and i should say that i have more than one to propose today it is to clarify that canadian jurisprudence continues to prevail since there seems to be ongoing debate about this we heard from legal scholar mary ellen turpel lafond who told our committee that the jurisprudence will evolve and that the and that the un declaration will not be subject to a bad decision from 30 years ago on the other hand we had minister lametti telling us that and i'm quoting from his testimony to committee canadian federal law and canadian provincial law also continue to exist and they will continue to be the last word in a number of different contexts end quote so as i said this is a clarifying amendment and is aimed at ensuring the law reflects what the minister has told this committee this amendment isn't saying that jurisprudence sorry this amendment isn't saying that jurisprudence isn't capable of changing or evolving but it is saying that the amendment is is saying that existing case law and jurisprudence continues to stand until the appropriate mechanisms are used to create that change thank you thank you senator patterson any comments or questions please senator labacaine vinson followed by senator foranisi thank you chair and thank you to my colleague who brought the amendment forward i would just note that bill c15 recognizes and affirms that the declaration can be used as an interpretive tool which may over time influence the development of canadian jurisprudence and by nature and definition canadian jurisprudence continues to apply in canada at the same time it can grow and evolve thank you thank you senator uh senator foranisi senator labacaine vinson said exactly what i was going to say i don't know that this is the an amendment that will bring the desired clarity in fact by expressing that notion in the bill i it may in my view tend to confuse things i think independently every piece of legislation that is accepted and to which royal assent is granted is subject to past judicial decisions and becomes an interpretive tool for future judicial decisions by its very nature thank you senator uh any other comments or questions senator stewart olson uh thank you chair i believe the amendment itself is dealing with future um and it's saying that you can't go back in the past and say this isn't this isn't uh appropriate the new the new laws or the new additions to the laws so i i i understand the the point it gives greater clarity for people who are trying to sort out the legalities and where we'll be going with all this new and yes senator labacaine benson we will be uh reviewing each piece of legislation i i would hope that's in the plan for the upcoming but it just clarifies the fact that we don't think it's necessary we don't want to go back and review it doesn't apply to things in the past it's just applying on a go-forward basis and that's not clear really in the existing existing law or the existing bill thank you senator uh any other comments and questions uh can i ask uh government officials if they wish to make any comments point of order mr chair yes thank you mr senator paterson uh mr chair i'm i'm grateful for the presence of government officials but i strongly do not believe that we should ask them to weigh in on our debate on amendments they are there as a resource to the committee and we should be able to call on them if there are technical questions that need to be answered but i would strongly object to the practice of having them comment on every amendment thank you thank you senator can i suspend just for a moment thank you clarification we'll suspend uh for a brief moment so ប្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្� ប្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្� ប្្្្្្្្្្្្្aleb Go ahead. Thank you, Andrea. The opinion is that the committee has the right to indeed hear from government officials. So I'll leave it to the committee to decide, but I notice Senator Tanis' hand is raised. So Senator Tanis. Thanks. I think the government officials can be, as Senator Paterson said, invaluable if we ask some specific questions, but for them to enter into debate when we're talking about amendment, I'll bet a bag of donuts that no government official is going to agree that it's a great amendment. The bill is perfect. That's their position. So I think we should share if any Senator has a specific question they want to ask a government official on, that's entirely in order and should be done so, but to throw a softball over to them and say, what do you think, guys? I don't think is appropriate. Agreed. Thank you, Senator Tanis. Senator Paterson, anything further? Mr. Chair, I just was wanting to clarify that I certainly did not question the right of officials to appear in the committee. I'm glad they're here and they should feel welcome. But they should only be available if the committee or member of the committee calls on them to clarify a usually a technical question. So I'd like to endorse what Senator Tanis said just now that it should not be the practice to call on them to comment on every amendment unless we need technical advice. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. So it sounds like to go forward here is that if any Senator wishes to ask the officials questions regarding the amendment, it is certainly within your right to do so. Any other comments and questions on that? Great. Thank you very much. So going back to the amendment in clause two, is there any further debate? Hearing none, I shall then ask shall clause two as amended carry. Agreed. No. No. No. No. No. Mr. Chair, I'll ask if you could call a suspension, please. Thank you, Senators. We'll suspend the meeting momentarily. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Shall the amendment carry. And please, you can vote by showing your card. If you agree, show to check. If you disagree, show the act. So, in favor, four, three, against, eight. I declare the amendment shall cause to carry. Vision on division on division. Thank you, Mr. Patterson. Thank you very much. That's much easier. You know, wish to go to clause number three, shall clause three carry. I've got an amendment on clause five, Mr. Chair. I'll just go through clause three, clause four, then clause five. So shall clause three carry? Agreed. I declare that clause three is carried. Clause four, shall clause four carry? I declare clause four carry. Shall clause five carry? Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move that Bill C-15 be amended in clause five on page five by replacing line nine with the following. Quote, necessary to ensure that federal acts and regulations are CONSIS- Clause five, Mr. Chair. Clause five, Mr. Chair. Clause five, Mr. Chair. Senator Patterson, on debate. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yes, clause five requires the government to take all measures necessary to ensure that the laws of Canada are consistent with the declaration. Laws of Canada suggests this includes laws of provinces and territories. I'm suggesting we change laws of Canada, which is a stylistic choice, with more clear wording. We heard from Champagne and Asiak that they believe this bill applies to Yukon. We also heard from Minister Dunn from New Brunswick that this was a concern. And you know, this brings up the important question of what happens if the federal parliament passes Bill C-15, but a province has not done so. How does this impact areas of shared jurisdiction, like health or environment, reviews? These are important questions that need to be clarified. And Premiers and Ministers representing Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick have all expressed this concern. The Minister told us unequivocally on May 31 that this review of laws only applies to federal laws and regulations. In the French version now, it's more clear and says Loi Federal. So we would be adding the word A Reglement to include regulations. And again, I think this is a clarifying amendment, which logically makes the English version clearly compatible with the French. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Senator Patterson. Senator Levene-Vincent. Thank you, Chair. I would just note that the French version of the law is not yet in the law. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would just note that this is consistent with how laws of Canada is used in some other forms of legislation, including the Income Facts Act, and that the Government of Canada understands that laws of Canada is used in clause five of the bill as being limited only to federal legislation passed by the Parliament of Canada. Thank you, Senator. Senator Furey-Neesing. May I ask the officials to clarify for us whether they estimate that this change would have any impact other than clarification? In other words, would it exclude laws that the bill was intended to include? Chair, if I might, I'm happy to respond to that briefly. Madame Chargent, please go ahead. Thank you. So, I would just note that I think there is a possibility that changing to federal acts and regulations might exclude some parts of what would be captured by laws of Canada by which, as the Minister has said and has been noted, we understand it to mean laws within the jurisdiction of federal Parliament. Partly because there may be areas of federal law that are not just statute-based, but that can go beyond that. They can be a federal common law, and that wouldn't be captured by acts and regulations. All that said, I would also note that adding regulations would be a change as well relative to the legislation as currently ranked. Thanks. Thank you, Ms. Chargent. Senator Stewart-Alson. Thank you, Chair. I would just note that as Senators, we represent our regions, and I feel quite strongly if we have this many provincial governments worried about this aspect, that it behooves us as their voice in the federal scene, we should give this some severe attention. Because I don't think any time you clarify a law, that's a bad thing. I think any time you don't is the bad thing. And I think we set up areas, we're trying not to set up areas for future litigation if we can possibly do that. So I would ask that we give this real consideration. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Stewart-Alson, Senator Ferey-Niessing, Senator Patterson, and Senator Gold. Senator Ferey-Niessing. I can't disagree with the desire for clarity, but I don't want to erroneously or inadvertently change the scope of the legislation for want of a clarification. The other point that I think is important to make, and Senator Patterson has pointed it out, and I'm making most of my comments in English today because I note that most of my colleagues in attendance are in English. So as a courtesy to you, I'll speak in English primarily. But if there is a discrepancy in the French version and the second, then there are two questions for us. The first is, which of the two do we wish to uphold? Is it going to be federal laws and regulations, or is it going to be the laws of Canada? Once we've settled on that, we will need to amend either the French version or the English version to ensure consistency. I would absolutely submit. Yeah, absolutely. Thank you, Senator. Senator Gold. Well, I think Senator Ferey-Niessing said it pretty much all, as did the officials. This doesn't clarify. It changes the scope in both directions, and I would argue that it's not necessary, nor is it desirable for that reason. Thank you, Senator. Senator Patterson. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just following up on Senator Ferey-Niessing's observation, and I respect that she is bilingual. She has suggested what I suggested is that there's a clear conflict between the English and French versions. And I wonder if we, if I could ask the official again, is which is going to prevail, federal laws, lois federal en français, or laws of Canada in English? Which is operative here? So, Mr. Chair, I will note on that point that the principle of statutory interpretation is that both languages are equally valid and will be looked to for purposes of interpretation or understanding what the legislative intent is. And perhaps, if I can, to pick up on a point made by Senator Ferey-Niessing, we actually see the use of lois federales to translate laws of Canada sometime. So those two phrases, the English laws of Canada and lois federales, as currently appear, are consistent in our experience. I will say there is a variety of terminology across the federal statute book. There isn't 100% consistency, so you will find some different wording in different federal statutes. But there are some examples where laws of Canada is translated as lois federales. There are some other terms used, but perhaps that's what I can add for the moment. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Sergeant. Senator Ferey-Niessing. Sorry, I pressed the wrong button. I cancelled the video and kept the mute on. That's a new one, actually. I'm usually just on mute. So, you know, I don't want to belabor the point, but I do think it's important since we're having a discussion specifically about the wording and the use of either laws, federal laws or laws of Canada, if we agree on one or the other, then I believe we should amend the other version to ensure consistency. So my respectful submission to all of you and Madame Sergeant was absolutely right. Both versions will have equal force and will be interpreted and may be interpreted differently if that consistency isn't attended to here and now. So my recommendation would therefore be and my position is that we should maintain laws of Canada, therefore defeat the intent of the motion being, of amendments being proposed by Senator Patterson, but I thank him for pointing out the inconsistency because I would then propose an amendment to the French version only to change the terms of the law. French version, federal law, all laws of Canada. Very simple. Laws of Canada, laws of Canada. Thank you, Senator. For Niseng, Senator Gold. You're on mute, Senator. I think we should move to the question, but I heard the I heard the officials say clearly there is no inconsistency between the English and French and for that reason I would move to the question. I'd ask you to move to the question. I'll be voting against the amendment. Thank you, Senator Gold. Senator Stuart Olson. Thank you, Chair and thank you, Senator Gold as leader of the government. I have to say that I totally support Senator for Niseng's motion or what she's saying it because I've sat in on many rules and regulation meetings where if the translation is not matched in the law, then if it's not consistent. The bill is ultimately rejected, sent back for months of revisions. This is such a simple thing, Senator Gold. It's a small clarification and we know what happens when the English doesn't translate into the French. I'm sorry, the officials, I of course are here and I get that, but I have seen too many problems when the official translations don't match. Thank you, Sanders. Any further debate on the motion? If not, it is moved by Senator Patterson that Bill C-15 be amended on clause five on page five at line nine. This is your pleasure, Honorable Sanders, to adopt the amendment. Keep your cards raised until the clerk has done the count. So, three, four, nine counts, nine again. I declare the amendment defeated. Shall clause five carry. Well, I thought Senator for Niseng was going to propose an amendment. Thank you, Senator. I'm concerned about proposing an amendment if it is the only one. If I would be, I would be satisfied to leave the wording as it is if there are no other amendments, if there are other amendments to the act, but if it is the only amendment, it is a housekeeping issue. But I would prefer, can we postpone this question until the end of the discussion and come back to clause 15? Or clause five, sorry? Okay, so we'll postpone the question of whether or not clause five will carry. Senator Labocaine-Benson. Thank you, Chair. I wonder if my colleague, Senator for Niseng, would consider making this an observation to the government that there could be, but there probably isn't a conflict, that in many cases we know that one means the other, and that we want to make sure that the government knows that one doesn't back mean the other, and propose an observation to that, in that direction. Thank you, Senator. Yes, I'm quite prepared to do that. I'll work on the wording and have it to you by the end of the meeting. Okay. Therefore, I shall ask, shall clause five carry? On division. On division. I declare that the motion has carried on division. We'll move on to clause six. Shall clause six carry? Senator Patterson. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move that Bill C-15 be amended in clause six on page five by adding the following after line 14. 1.1. The consultations referred to in subsection one must include consultations with representatives from A. Councils, governments, or other entities that are authorized to act on behalf of an Indigenous group, community, or people that hold rights recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. B. Groups and organizations that work with or advocate on behalf of Indigenous women, Indigenous youth, and urban Indigenous populations. C. Groups and communities of Indigenous peoples, including those who are parties to or the subject of a treaty, including a land claims agreement or a self-government agreement. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. On debate. Thank you, Mr. Chair. This is an amendment to the clause that deals with the establishment of the action plan. I believe committee members are well aware of the testimony that we have received seriously criticizing the government on their consultation record. We heard from treaties six, seven, and eight about their bilateral agreements being eroded by consistent engagement of this government with the Assembly of First Nations, a national Indigenous organization that we were repeatedly told is an advocacy group and not a rights holder. We heard that the Native Women's Association of Canada had to fight to get to the table. I won't describe the actors in the national organizations pejoratively, but they are all men. And they said that they were prepared to continue fighting for a seat at the action table, at the action plan table. We read in the Canadian Roots Exchange submission calls on the government to ensure that they are not, quote, tokenizing youth, end quote. And we heard from witnesses like Mr. Russ Diabo representing grassroots organizations and Grand Chief Joel Abram from the Association of Iroquois and Allied Indians that the consultation on this bill was dismal. I'd also point out that the consultation record provided of sessions occurred before the tabling of this bill, which was included as Appendix B of the report entitled What We Learned, tabled by the government, listed Treaty Six, Treaty Eight, and Excelling Alexander First Nation as organizations that had been consulted with. And I found it particularly disturbing to have those organizations, those rights holders listed in that appendix when we heard from each of them that they had not been consulted. We also had an official state, in addition to what was in the What We Learned report, that indeed they were consulted. Now Grand Chief Watchmaker was quite clear in his testimony, and he reiterated this in his follow up submission that states, The bill does not meet the minimum standards that the UN Declaration of Rights on Indigenous Peoples attempted to achieve or the definition provided by the Yellowhead Institute. He said, Canada has diluted it, is forcing artificial timelines, not talking with the rights holders, manufacturing consent with corporate bodies, and provided us with little to no information. Most of the information we have to date is from listening to the Senate Committee on this bill. Clearly a breach of our treaty relationship. So colleagues, this amendment would attempt to ensure that the right people are around the table from the very beginning, because we've heard a lot of testimony that this wasn't the case on this bill. The government engaged with national Indigenous organizations very early on in June and developed a draft which was then presented to rights holders in October, November. This is not the way to consult, according to the UNDRIP declaration. You involve them from the beginning in developing the proposals. You don't present them with a draft and say, do you like it or not? It also clarifies the commitments that we heard made by ministers during their testimony to be inclusive and collaborative. Joint development was the co-development, joint development were the phrases that were used. So it would ensure that it really is, to quote Minister of Crown Indigenous Relations Carolyn Bennett, it really is, the development of the action plan really is nothing about us without us. You don't talk about rights holders without them being there at the table and don't risk leaving out everyone, including women, youth, and as I say, the all-important rights holders. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Senator Patterson. Senator LeBoucain-Vincent, followed by Senator Coyle and Senator Ferre-Nissing. Senator LeBoucain-Vincent. Thank you, Chair. Senator Coyle had her hand up before me, so I'm happy to wait until she's done. Thank you. Senator Coyle. Thank you very much. And I want to thank Senator Patterson for both what you've mentioned in debate and what you have put in this amendment. I think the intent of what you have put forward here is something that is easy for us to embrace the spirit of what you have put here, and you will have seen from the many observations from various senators, including myself, that I have actually articulated something very similar that I'm hoping will be considered in an observation when we get to that point in this meeting. I think that it can be handled in an observation. I think we absolutely need to say something. I don't believe that we need to say it in an amendment form, though. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Coyle. Senator LeBoucain-Vincent. Thank you, Chair. I would just add that including a list of specific groups to consult would run the risk of being over or under inclusive, and particularly if drafted and inserted without the benefit of the input from the full diversity of Indigenous peoples. And so I would agree with Senator Coyle that there, you know, in our observations, we will have much to say about consultation, but not in an amendment. Thank you. Senator? Senator Ferre-Niessing, followed by Senator Deakin. Senator Ferre-Niessing. So my position is quite similar to that expressed on my two colleagues. I do have a concern about listing groups for two reasons. Not only is there a risk of being over or under inclusive, but there is, in my respectful submission, a risk of being further seen as being, as perpetuating colonialism. If it isn't the law to, and if we select the groups that must be consulted, I think that's where we might be going in the wrong direction. I believe very strongly in the intent, and I thank Senator Patterson for raising this issue. But I agree with Senator Coyle that we can and should raise this in an observation, and many of us have similar observations, and we'll have a fun time putting all of those ideas together into one. But until we get there, I really fear that an amendment such as this one will not give way to what I hope will be an undertaking not only by the government to ensure that everyone who needs to be at the table is at the table, but an undertaking on the part of our Indigenous people that, depending on the issue that's at hand, that those that are at the table are not going to be able to do that. I also believe that it is up to the diverse Indigenous communities to ensure that those that are at the table represent them and negotiate and consent on their behalf, and if not, to make sure that whoever else must be at that table is at the table. Thank you, Senator. Senator Deacon, followed by Senator Patterson. Thank you, and no need to repeat. I appreciate that. I'm the last three colleagues, and thank you, Senator Patterson. I would like to see this absolutely in observation, and under the auspices are the umbrella of consultation and engagement. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. Senator Patterson. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just want to say briefly that the list proposed in this amendment is a non-exhaustive list. It doesn't suggest it includes everyone, so I say that to answer concerns about it being too prescriptive. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. Any further debate? If not, it is moved by the Honourable Senator Patterson that Bill C-15 be amended on clause 6, page 5, at line 14. This is your pleasure, Honourable Senators, to adopt the amendment. Please hold your cards. 3, 4, 4, 9, again, 9, con. Thank you, Senators. I declare the amendment defeated. Shall clause 6 carry. On division. On division. We'll move on to clause 7. Shall clause 7 carry. 8, 4, 8, 4, 0, again. I declare clause 7 carry. We are now into the schedule. Shall the schedule carry? A point of order, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Senator Patterson. Go ahead. Did we miss clause 8? Does that have an amendment to clause 8? Right. Yeah, my text doesn't have clause 8. Because there is no clause 8, the amendment is to add a clause. Okay, I'm sorry. Thank you. Well, Mr. Chair, before we go to the schedule, I would like to move an amendment to add a new clause 8. Please, Senator Patterson, go ahead with your motion. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, I represent a region that includes the minority of Aboriginal people in Canada, Indigenous people in Canada, the Inuit. And so I, on their behalf, wish to bring forward an amendment that I have resolved to bring forward. And it's the only one that I wouldn't describe as a clarifying amendment. The Inuit engaged fully in the consultation process on C-15. And they have been clear, consistent, and unanimous. That is all four regions of Inuit Nunangat, from Nunatsiavut, Nunavut, and the Inuvialuit region in the Northwest Territories. Clear and unanimous in their insistence that we bring forward an Indigenous Human Rights Council as an accountability and enforcement measure within this bill. This amendment is in keeping with an Inuit Taparit Kanata Mi ITK Board of Directors resolution from March 31, 2021, that says they support C-15, but also support the advancement of this proposal for an Indigenous Human Rights Council as an accountability and enforcement measure. Which is otherwise lacking in accountability and enforcement measures. ITK President Natan Obed and Nunavut Tungivik, Incorporated President Aluki Kotilk called for this in their testimony. The Inuvialuit Regional Corporation reiterated their preference to see C-15 go through with this important measure included in their written submission to the committee. And so this amendment is essentially the wording they brought forward, which was fine-tuned by the law clerk's office based on legislative drafting principles. Mr. Chair, the Inuit have presented amendments to important legislation affecting their rights, respecting Indigenous languages, which were actually supported by this committee, rejected by the government. And I'm hoping that again today, out of respect for the Inuit, this committee will support this amendment recommended by them. And I ask for your thoughtful consideration of this amendment. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Patterson. Senator Coyle. Thank you, Senator Patterson. Like you, I always listen when Natan Obed and Aluki Kotilk and others from the Arctic region of Canada representing the Inuit population speak. I think it's very important to listen to what they have to say. And like you, I considered, I didn't act on, but I did consider supporting them with an amendment. I came to a different conclusion though for two reasons. One, I agree with the need for accountability that they are concerned about. And I think their concern about accountability would be shared beyond the Inuit population in Canada. I do believe that there is plenty of scope though in the action planning process to actually consider this. And in fact, that that may be a better time to do that, rather than us taking it from one group and sort of imposing it at this point. Not having really had a chance to test the idea with other Indigenous peoples and leaders across Canada. So I would hope that this idea, this accountability mechanism, the Indigenous Human Rights Commission would be something that would be considered and discussed thoroughly with all parties during that action planning process, which will take place as a As we know, hopefully as soon as this bill is passed. So I do support the intent, but believe that it will require further consultation with other Indigenous groups. And that does not mean to say that I do not take very seriously this amendment that they had asked us to put forward. So thank you for doing that, Senator. Thank you, Senator Coyle. Senator Francis. Thank you, Chair. I'm supportive with greater accountability and enforcement mechanisms, but I remember multiple Inuit organizations noted that they would not be supportive of amendments that would defeat the bill. There's an understanding that these measures and others could be examined further through a distinctions based lens during the action plan. And as a result, I do not support this amendment, but I commend Senator Patterson for his advocacy. We should consider putting an observation that accountability and enforcement mechanisms are part of the initial phase of the action plan. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Francis. Any further debate? Mr. Chair. Yes. If I may just a quick point of order before you proceed to a vote, I believe that the mover will be required to read his motion or the text of his motion into the record. Okay, Senator Patterson. I oblige you to read your text. Read your motion. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair, and it is follows that Bill C-15 be amended on page six by adding the following after line 26. 8. One, the minister must in consultation and collaboration with Indigenous peoples and the representatives develop a proposal to establish an Indigenous rights, Indigenous Human Rights Commission. Two, the proposal must set out the following in relation to the commission. A, a proposal must include the mandate, powers, duties and functions. B, an estimate of the funds required for its establishment and operation. C, a location for its head office. D, its composition, which must include First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples. E, a process for the appointment of commissioners, including prior consultations with First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples. And F, a process and timeframe for its establishment. Thank you, Senator. Any further debate? Mr. Chair. Senator Patterson. I'd just like to respond to Senator Francis and, you know, I would also before I do so, thank colleagues on the committee who've thanked me for bringing this amendment forward. Senator Francis suggested that voting for the amendment would defeat the bill, and I just want to make it clear. My intentions with this amendment and with the other amendments were to clarify and improve the bill, not to defeat it. So I haven't talked about defeating the bill. I've talked about approving it and strengthening it, and this amendment is about improving and strengthening the enforcement and accountability provisions in the bill, not defeating it. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Patterson. Any further debate? It is moved by the Honourable Senator Patterson that Bill C-15 be amended on clause 8 on page 6 of line 26. Is it your pleasure, Honourable Sanders, to adopt the amendment? Please hold your cards so the clerk can do the count. 4, 8 again. Thank you. I declare the amendment defeated. We will now go to the schedule. Shall the schedule carry? 8, 4, 8, 4, 0 again. I declare the schedule carried. Shall clause 1, which contains the short title, carry? 10, 4, 10, 4, 0, 0 again. I declare clause 1, carry. Shall the preamble carry? Senator Patterson. Thank you. Sorry, you're muted, Senator. I move that Bill C-15 be amended in the preamble on page 3 by adding the following after line 4. Whereas implementation of the declaration affirms the importance of Indigenous rights to economic prosperity, and the Government of Canada must, through accelerated economic inclusion of Indigenous peoples in partnership with them and their institutions, remedy the disadvantages imposed on generations of Indigenous peoples by laws and policies designed to restrict access to lands and resources, quality education, skills development, capital, infrastructure, and business ownership. Thank you. On debate, Senator. This final amendment is based on testimony from the Indigenous Resource Council, the National Coalition of Chiefs, and is also based on the joint letter from business organizations, such as the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business, the National Aboriginal Capital Corporation Association, and so forth. Minister Lamedi stated that, quote, the declaration itself, as well as the rights contained in the preamble, have interpretive force in Canadian law, end quote. This clarifies that the bill should be interpreted with a view that confirms the Government of Canada's belief in economic inclusion and economic reconciliation, which is also clearly contemplated in UNDRIP's core principles. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Patterson. Senator LeBecayne Benson, followed by Senator Francis. Thank you, Chair. Yes, I agree, and many of us agree that Indigenous participation in economic development is critical. But the preamble already reflects these concepts in several paragraphs that highlight Indigenous peoples' political, economic, and social rights. And in addition, the declaration itself speaks to the rights relating to economic development in many places. Thank you, Senator. Senator Francis. Thank you, Chair. I'm sure that Bill CE15 receives royal assent at this stage of the proceedings. The best way to address the importance of economic inclusion is through observations. That is what I intend to do later today. In suggesting this approach, I note this amendment is based on a House of Commons submission from several Indigenous economic development organizations. Indeed, three of those, three of the four organizations appeared at our committee. The National Indigenous Economic Development Board, the National Aboriginal Capital Corporations Association, and the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business. These organizations are very clear that while they would like to see economic issues highlighted, they strongly support Bill CE15 and do not wish to see the final vote delayed. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Francis. Any further debate? It is moved by the Honourable Senator Patterson that Bill CE15 be amended on page three on line four. This is your pleasure, Honourable Senators, to adopt the amendment. I declare the amendment defeated. Shall the preamble carry? 8-4-0 against 0-3. I declare the preamble carried. Shall the title carry? 9-4-0 against 0-3. I declare the title carried. Shall the bill carry? Chair, point of order. Thank you very much, Senator Tannis. Go ahead. I just wanted to check. Did we pass clause five? We did. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Tannis. The question is, shall the bill carry? 9-4-9-4, two abstentions, chair. I declare the bill carried. That concludes our clause-by-clause review of Bill CE15. We wish now to proceed to the observation. I see nods. Rule 12-16, sub one, sub D, allows us to go in camera to discuss a draft report. Does the committee wish to discuss the observations in camera? Agreed. Agreed. We will now suspend the meeting until we can go into camera. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
